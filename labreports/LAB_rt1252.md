2. Click the sign in button in the top right corner.

   Pretty simple and intuitive, common username and password prompts.

   ![Logged in homepage](/images/indeed/4_action1_homepage_logged_in.png)
   This page shows recommended jobs based on my preferences along with a job search bar.
5. To get to my profile to update my profile with additional skills I am going to click the user icon.
   ![User icon](/images/indeed/5_action1_user_icon.png)
   Clicking the icon does not take me to a new page but shows me a list of options.
6. I am going to going to click the top option, profile.
   ![Profile](/images/indeed/6_action1_profile.png)
   This page shows all of my information that I have previously added, along with options to change that information. 
7. I am going to click qualifications since it skills and experience which is what I want.
![Qualifications](/images/indeed/7_action1_qualifications.png)
It does not look like I have actually added any information here, so lets add skills.
8. Click add skills.
![Add skills](/images/indeed/8_action1_add_skills.png)
The popup input field has two pieces of information to input, skill which is typed and years of experience which is a dropdown.
9. Click save.
![Updated qualification page](/images/indeed/9_action1_qualifications_updated_with_skills.png)
I am brought back to the qualifications page where I will now add a certification to see if the process is any different.
10.  Click add certifications.
![Add certifications](/images/indeed/10_action1_add_cert.png)
The popup input field is almost identical to that which we saw when adding skills. 
11.   Click save.
![Updated qualification page](/images/indeed/11_action1_qualifications_updated_2.png)
12. That is it for the process of getting into my account and adding skills/certifications.
