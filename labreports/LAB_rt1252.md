## 2.2 Site 1 - Indeed
Note I already have an Indeed account.

I. Action 1: Create an account on the site and update your skills or preferred job interests.

1. Navigate to [Indeed homepage](https://www.indeed.com/).
   ![Home Page](/images/indeed/1_action1_homepage.png)
2. Click the sign in button in the top right corner.
   ![Login screen](/images/indeed/2_action1_login.png)
   The login page offers many SSO options, I have an indeed account by email which is autofilled by LastPass.
3. Click continue to be prompted for password.
   ![Password screen](/images/indeed/3_action1_password.png)
   Pretty simple and intuitive, common username and password prompts.
4. I am brought to a new homepage now that I am logged in
   ![Logged in homepage](/images/indeed/4_action1_homepage_logged_in.png)
   This page shows recommended jobs based on my preferences along with a job search bar.
5. To get to my profile to update my profile with additional skills I am going to click the user icon.
   ![User icon](/images/indeed/5_action1_user_icon.png)
   Clicking the icon does not take me to a new page but shows me a list of options.
6. I am going to going to click the top option, profile.
   ![Profile](/images/indeed/6_action1_profile.png)
   This page shows all of my information that I have previously added, along with options to change that information. 
7. I am going to click qualifications since it skills and experience which is what I want.
![Qualifications](/images/indeed/7_action1_qualifications.png)
It does not look like I have actually added any information here, so lets add skills.
8. Click add skills.
![Add skills](/images/indeed/8_action1_add_skills.png)
The popup input field has two pieces of information to input, skill which is typed and years of experience which is a dropdown.
9. Click save.
![Updated qualification page](/images/indeed/9_action1_qualifications_updated_with_skills.png)
I am brought back to the qualifications page where I will now add a certification to see if the process is any different.
10.   Click add certifications.
![Add certifications](/images/indeed/10_action1_add_cert.png)
The popup input field is almost identical to that which we saw when adding skills. 
11.    Click save.
![Updated qualification page](/images/indeed/11_action1_qualifications_updated_2.png)
1.  That is it for the process of getting into my account and adding skills/certifications. 

II. Action 2: Search for a job and take all the necessary steps right up to applying for the job.

1.  Navigate to the [Indeed homepage](https://www.indeed.com/) and insert my search query.
![Home Page](/images/indeed/12_action2_homepage.png)
The search bar was very easy to find at the top of the page.
2.  Click search.
![Search results](/images/indeed/13_action2_results.png)
There are search result filter dropdowns that I could use to become more granular, however I am not picky and want to see what the initial results show.
3.  Scroll until I find an internship that I will like... it does not take much searching as there are only three results. I have a family friend that does IT for the Hershey company so I will choose the second option. 
![Hershey listing](/images/indeed/14_action2_hershey.png)
There are two scroll bars, one to scroll through the search results and another scroll bar to view the job posting information. 
4. I use the scroll bar for the job listing to scroll until I can see relevant information like responsibilities, qualifications, and education.  
![Job information](/images/indeed/15_action2_info.png)
From here I can determine that I am qualified for this internship.
5. Click the blue apply on company site button, I am redirected to the [job on Hershey's career website](https://careers.thehersheycompany.com/job/Hershey-Intern-Cyber-Defense-%28Summer-2023%29-PA-17033/990496400/).
![Job listing on Hershey's career website](/images/indeed/16_action2_hersheysite.png)
From here I can read the same information that I just read on Indeed, I also have the option to look for more jobs using the prominent search bar.
6. Click the purple apply now button.
![Apply button](/images/indeed/17_action2_apply.png)
The apply button shows me two ways to apply, I am going to select apply now without Linkedin because it always messes up the formatting and I end up having to retype everything anyway.
7. Click apply now without Linkedin. I am now brought to the Hershey career login page, I do not have an account so I will create one by clicking "create an account".
![Hershey career login page](/images/indeed/18_action2_login.png)
8. I autofill my information with LastPass.
![Create account](/images/indeed/19_action2_create_acc.png)
9. I have to click the "read and accept the data privacy statement".
![Data privacy statement](/images/indeed/20_action2_data_privacy.png)
It does not look like it will force me to scroll to the bottom to click accept and I am lazy and do not feel like reading this so I will click accept.
10. Click the accept blue button and then the create account blue button. I am presented with an email verification.
![One time password](/images/indeed/21_action2_otp.png)
This step is confusing, as it says they sent me a one-time password even though they just asked me to set a password. It seems that this is more of an email verification check than a otp.
11. I enter the one-time password and click continue. I am finally brought to an application page.
![Hershey application page](/images/indeed/22_action2_apply.png)
I am glad all the required application information is presented on one page, I hate when you have to click through multiple pages. There are also buttons to expand and collapse all sections which can make my application process easier. They also have nice easy to find save and apply buttons. 

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |3|The Indeed website is incredibly simple, there was not a single moment where I was confused as to where to go next.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |1|The Indeed website got me to my destination very quickly, the problem is that all Indeed is a complied job board site that redirects me to another website where I have to create an account all over again. This is typically for job applications but it would be nicer if I never had to leave Indeed's website.|
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |3| The Indeed website definitely had a visual hierarchy, you could tell what was the most important, you did not even need an account to search for jobs. The areas were very nicely broken up into smaller sections, for example accessing my profile and making changes could have been very complex but it was made easy with nice buttons. The colors of the buttons also help indicate what was the most important. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |3|There was not a single time were I was annoyed because I did not know where to navigate to next. The websites main goal was to clearly get me to search for a job. This was made clear by the prevalence of the job search bar.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |3|This was honestly what the website did best. It made everything else so easy to navigate and find because there was not tons of junk on the page. The pages were so minimalistic that there is no way that you could not get confused about what a page's purpose is.|
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |3|The navigation/workflow of the website was so simple, most internet proficient users would have absolutely no problem using this site. From the homepage once signed in you had a few options. In the top left you have discover jobs (what most people come to use), company reviews, and find salaries. In the top left side you had a messaging bubble to view messages, a bell icon to show any notifications, and a user icon to display profile options. This layout could not get not get any simpler.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |2|This category is a little more difficult for me to score as I am not super knowledgeable in the realm of accessibility. I did not notice any accessibility icons on the page (typically the person with their arms out in a circle), they did have a footer about their accessibility policy. The policy says that their website follows the WCAG standards. However, the only accessibility technology that I see that they support are third party tools and extensions. I also assume that the double scroll bar when searching for jobs could be problematic for certain users.  |
| **TOTAL** |18|Overall I really liked the website other than the fact that I was redirected to another website to actually apply.  |

## 2.3 Site 2 - Linkedin
Note I already have an Indeed account.

I. Action 1: Create an account on the site and update your skills or preferred job interests.

1. Navigate to [Linkedin homepage](https://www.linkedin.com/home).
![Home Page](/images/linkedin/01_linkedin_home.png)
My credentials are autofilled by LastPass again, I will click the sign in button.
2. I am brought to my "feed".
![Feed](/images/linkedin/02_feed.png)
Linkedin has a few more social networking features than Indeed, so I am presented with quite a few more options. The home page is a lot more crowded than on Indeed. I do not think this is a bad thing since Indeed has more functionality, just worth noting.
3. To get to my profile to update my profile with additional skills I am going to click the me button that has an image of my profile picture.
![Profile button](/images/linkedin/03_me.png)
This is very similar to the Indeed profile button, it shows a dropdown of options that I have. I really am not sure here where to go to update my skills/experience. I am not 100% sure where to go next, I am going to try clicking view profile.
4. Okay I was right, clicking view profile was the correct option. I am presented with my profile, I will scroll down until I find my experience, education, certifications, and skills.
![Profile](/images/linkedin/04_profile.png)
Note, I have zoomed out to be able to show what the education, certifications, and skills look like.
5. I am going to add a new skill but before I do, I am going to click the show all skills button so I do not accidentally readd a skill that I already have.
